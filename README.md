### Using the scripts
To use the `run_analysis.R` script:
 
* download the [dataset] [1].
* extract it and rename the resulting folder to `dataset` so that it is placed next to the R script (which will directly reference into `./dataset/`)
* next start R and set the directory where the R script is as current working dir
* source `run_analysis.R`
* it will produce the `tidy.csv` file as also committed to this repo. 

### more information
More information can be found in the documentation of [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) and in the [code book](code_book.md)
